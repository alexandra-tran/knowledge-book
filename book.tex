\chapter*{Preface}
This book contains knowledge that that me or my peers have obtained, the purpose is to explain things fundamentally and in full detail so that someone who has never touched the subject may be able to understand it. It will focus on conveying the ideas that are involved in synthesizing the new knowledge with less of a focus on the results themselves.


\section*{Structure of book}
The book is partitioned into different sections based on the domain it is involved with. There may be shared definitions and theorems throughout the chapters, but in general it will start more elementary and get more advanced.

\section*{Knowledge}
In this book you will find many results, will will characterize them as being one of the following
\begin{itemize}
    \item Theorems - Results that are of importantance and who's proof is not easily found (maybe using a novel idea)
  \item Propositions - Results of less importance who's proof could be constructed without a novel idea
  \item Lemmas - Results that are technical intermediate steps which has no standing as an independent result on first observation \footnote[2]{But sometimes they escape, as their usage becomes more than just an intermediate step,  as Zorn's or Fatou's Lemmas did}
    \item Corollaries - Results which follow readily  from an existing result of greater importance
\end{itemize}

\section*{Recommendations}
By now you might know that in order to actually get better at mathematics you have to engage with it. This book may be used as a reference at times, but I highly recommend trying to re-prove statements or coming up with your own ideas before instantly looking at the solutions.

\chapter*{Contributing}
 
Contributions to the project are very welcome, let's delve into how to get started with this.

If you want to contribute to the project it's most likely that a contribution will fall into one of the following categories
\begin{itemize}
  \item Content Based 
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Adding Definitions, Theorems, \ldots
      \item Finishing TODO's
      \item Formatting of the book
  \end{itemize}
  \item Structural Layout of Project 
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Organization
      \item Simplyfing the existing structure of the directories 
      \item Making scripts which set up new structures
  \end{itemize}
  \item External
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Adding explanatory content to help onboard new users
      \item Getting others involved
      \item Creating infrastructure to support users (Github discussions)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
