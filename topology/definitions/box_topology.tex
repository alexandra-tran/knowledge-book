\begin{definition}{Box Topology}{box_topology}
Let $\left\{X_{\alpha}\right\}_{\alpha \in J}$ be an indexed family of topological spaces. Let us take as a basis for a topology on the product space
$$
\prod_{\alpha \in J} X_{\alpha}
$$
the collection of all sets of the form
$$
\prod_{\alpha \in J} U_{\alpha}
$$
where $U_{\alpha}$ is open in $X_{\alpha}$, for each $\alpha \in J$. The topology generated by this basis is called the box topology.
\end{definition}
