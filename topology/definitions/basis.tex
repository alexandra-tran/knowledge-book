\begin{definition}{Basis}{basis}
    If $X$ is a set, a basis for a topology on $X$ is a collection $\mathcal{B}$ of subsets of $X$ (called basis elements) such that
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item For each $x \in X$, there is at least one basis element $B$ containing $x$.
        \item If $x$ belongs to the intersection of two basis elements $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$, then there is a basis element $B_{3}$ containing $x$ such that $B_{3} \subset B_{1} \cap B_{2}$.
    \end{enumerate}
    If $\mathcal{B}$ satisfies these two conditions, then we define the topology $\mathcal{T}$ generated by $\mathcal{B}$ as follows: $A$ subset $U$ of $X$ is said to be open in $X$ (that is, to be an element of $\mathcal{T}$) if for, each $x \in U$, there is a basis element $B \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x \in B$ and $B \subset U$. Note that each basis element is itself an element of $\mathcal{T}$.
\end{definition}
