The collection of $\Sigma$-formulas is defined as the smallest set of $\mathcal{L}_{N T}$ formulas such that:
1. Every atomic formula is a $\Sigma$-formula.
2. Every negation of an atomic formula is a $\Sigma$-formula.
3. If $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are $\Sigma$-formulas, then $\alpha \wedge \beta$ and $\alpha \vee \beta$ are both $\Sigma$-formulas.
4. If $\alpha$ is a $\Sigma$-formula, and $x$ is a variable that does not occur in the term $t$, then the following are $\Sigma$-formulas: $(\forall x<t) \alpha,(\forall x \leq t) \alpha$, $(\exists x<t) \alpha,(\exists x \leq t) \alpha$.
5. If $\alpha$ is a $\Sigma$-formula and $x$ is a variable, then $(\exists x) \alpha$ is a $\Sigma$-formula.
