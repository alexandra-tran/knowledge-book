\begin{proposition}{Contradiction has no Model}{contradiction_has_no_model}
    \begin{center}
        There is no $\mathcal{L}$-Structure $ \mathfrak{ A }   $ such that $ \mathfrak{ A } \models \bot $ 
    \end{center}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose there was a model of $ \bot $, that would mean that we have an $\mathcal{L}$-Structure $ \mathfrak{ A }     $ such that $ \mathfrak{ A } \models \bot  $. Recall that $ \bot :\equiv \left[ \left( \forall x \right) x =  x \right] \land \neg \left[ \left( \forall x \right)x =  x \right] $, so then we would have to have $ \mathfrak{ A } \models  \left( \forall x \right)x =  x   $ and also not have $ \mathfrak{ A } \models \left( \forall x \right) x =  x  $ which is a contradiction.
\end{proof}
