\begin{proposition}{Implying a Contradiction Means no Model}{implying_a_contradiction_means_no_model}
Let $ \Sigma  $ be a set of sentences, then if 
\[
\Sigma \models \bot 
\]
then $ \Sigma  $ has no model
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Recall that $ \Sigma \models \bot  $ means that for any $\mathcal{L}$-Structure $ \mathfrak{ A }   $ we have that 
            \[
            \mathfrak{ A } \models \Sigma ~\text{implies}~ \mathfrak{ A } \models \bot    
            \]
            but recall that $ \mathfrak{ A } \models \bot   $ is always false, therefore for the implication to hold we require that $ \mathfrak{ A } \models \Sigma   $ to be false, which means $ \Sigma  $ has no model as $ \mathfrak{ A }   $ was arbitrary.
    \end{itemize}
\end{proof}
