\begin{theo*}{Vector Space Unique Inverse}
  Every element in a vector space $ V$ has a unique additive inverse.
  \begin{pf}
    Suppose $ V$ is a vector space, and let $  v \in V$ and supppose we have two additive inverses of $ v$, call them $ x$ and $ y$, where $ x \neq  y$. In that case
    Thus $ x =  y$, a contradiction, so we know that there is a unique additive inverse.
  \end{pf}
\end{theo*}
