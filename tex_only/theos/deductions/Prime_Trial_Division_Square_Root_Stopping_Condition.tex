\begin{deduction*}{Prime Trial Division Square Root Stopping Condition}
    One method for deducing if a number $ n$  is prime is to check all of it's divisors, if it turns out that the only divisors are one and itself, then the number is prime. \\
    It turns out that you only have to check the if the numbers from $ 2$ up until $ \sqrt{n}$ divide $ n$ (knowing that if one does that $ n$ is not prime), and if none divide it, then the number is prime. We will prove why this is the case
    \begin{pf}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item We will prove that by checking all numbers in the range $ 2$  to $ \sqrt{n}$ divides $ n$ exahausts all divisors of $ n$.
            \item To do so we utilize the "bijection between"
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item For any such divisor, we get another divisor from $ \sqrt{n}$ to $ n-1$ by using the bijection
                    \item Therefore by the time we have checked all divisors from $ 2$  to $ \sqrt{n}$ we have also checked all divisors from $ \sqrt{n}$  to $ n - 1$ 
                \end{itemize}
            \item If any divisor is found in the range then we know that $ n$ is not prime
            \item If no divisor is found in the range, then it means that there is no divisor in the range $ \sqrt{n}$ to $ n - 1$, therefore the number's only divisors are one and itself, so it is prime.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{pf}
\end{deduction*}
