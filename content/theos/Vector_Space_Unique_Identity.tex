\begin{proposition}{Vector Space Unique Identity}
  Let $ V$ be a vector space and suppose that $ 0 $ and $ 0 ^{\prime} $ are two different ($ 0 \neq  0 ^{\prime} $) identities, then 
  from commutivity and the definition of identity element, therefore $ 0 =  0 ^{\prime} $ which is a contradiction.
\end{proposition}
