\begin{proposition}{Number of K-Permutations of a Set with N Elements}
  The number of permutations mapping $k$ elements to $k$ elements on a set $X$ with $n$ elements is 
  \[
  \frac{n!}{ \left( n  - k \right)!}
  \]
  \begin{pf}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Firstly we know that $f\left(1\right) = x_1$ where $x_1 \in  \left[ n \right]$, so $f\left(1\right)$ has $n$ different options to map to
      \item Now say $ f\left(2\right) = x_{2}$, then it could be one of $ \left[ n \right] \setminus \left\{ x_{1} \right\}$, so there are $n-2$ options for what $f\left(2\right)$ could be
      \item Then $n-3$ options for $f\left(3\right)$ and in general there will be $n  - i + 1$ options for $f\left(i\right)$
      \item Following this, an enumeration of all the possible permutations would be:
          \item Notice that there are $k$ terms involved in the above product
        \end{itemize}
      \item Which is exactly
        \[
        \frac{n!}{ \left(  n  - k \right)!}
        \]
    \end{itemize}
  \end{pf}
