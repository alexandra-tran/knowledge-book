{The Finite Complement Topology is a Topology}
    Let \(X\) be any set and \(\mathcal{T} _{f}\) be the finite complement topology on \(X\), we'll show that it's indeed a topology
    \begin{pf}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Note that \(\varnothing ^{\complement} = X\) which is all of \(X\) thus \(\varnothing \in \mathcal{T} _{f}\) and that \(X ^{\complement} = \varnothing\) which is finite thus \(X \in \mathcal{T} _{f}\)
            \item Let \(U_{1}, U_{2}, \dotsc, U_{n - 1}, U_{n}\) be in \(\mathcal{T}_{f}\) we'll show that
                \[
                \bigcap_{i = 1}^{n} U_{i} \in \mathcal{T} _{f}
                \]
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Note that by demorgan's laws we have that
                    \[
                    \left(\bigcap_{i = 1}^{n} U_{i}\right) ^{\complement} = \bigcup_{i = 1}^{n} \left(U_{i}\right) ^{\complement}
                    \]
                \item And by assumption that each \(U_{j} \in \mathcal{T} _{f} \) we know that each \(U_{j} ^{\complement}\) is either finite or all of \(X\)
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item If any one of the complements are \(X\) then the union is all of \(X\), if no such complement is \(X\) then they are all finite, and a finite union of finite sets is finite, so we conclude
                        \[
                        \bigcap_{i = 1}^{n} U_{i} \in \mathcal{T} _{f}
                        \]
                \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}
            \item Let \(I\) be some indexing set, we will show that
                \[
                \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} U _{\alpha} \in \mathcal{T} _{f}
                \]
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Again we leverage DeMorgan's Laws (which hold on finite or infinite sets), so we have:
                    \[
                   \left(\bigcup_{\alpha \in I} U _{\alpha}\right) ^{\complement} = \bigcap_{\alpha \in I} \left(U _{\alpha}\right) ^{\complement}
                    \]
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item If each one of \(\left(U _{\beta}\right) ^{\complement}\) are all of \(X\) then the intersection is all of \(X\), if any one of the complements are finite, then the union is also finite, thus \(\left(\bigcup_{\alpha \in I} U _{\alpha}\right) ^{\complement} = \bigcap_{\alpha \in I} \left(U _{\alpha}\right) ^{\complement}\) as needed.
                \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{pf}
\end{proposition}
