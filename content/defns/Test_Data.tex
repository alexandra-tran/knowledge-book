\begin{definition}{Test Data}
    Test data is a subset of some data collection which is the final stage in testing a learning model, even after using the validation data to tune our hyper parameters it could be the case that our hyperparameters have been chosen in such a way as to ``memorize" or overfit the validation data, therefore to check our true generalization accuracy the test set is used.
