Note that the triangle equality is intuitively telling us that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line

\section{Limits}

\input{analysis/propositions/limit_of_constant}
Notice that in the above proof that we didn't use our hypothesis in the proof of the consequent, which makes sense because no matter which interval you look in the function is constant there, thus it doesn't depend on the hypothesis at all.

\section{Differentiation}

\input{analysis/theorems/chain_rule}
\input{analysis/propositions/little_oh_and_differentiability_equivalence}
Notice that the number $ \alpha $ is equal to a limit and that limits are unique, therefore the solution $ \alpha =  f ^{ \prime } \left( \overline{x} \right)  $ is the unique solution to the above proposition.
