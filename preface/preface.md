# Preface {#preface .unnumbered}

This book contains knowledge that that me or my peers have obtained, the
purpose is to explain things fundamentally and in full detail so that
someone who has never touched the subject may be able to understand it.
It will focus on conveying the ideas that are involved in synthesizing
the new knowledge with less of a focus on the results themselves.

## Structure of book {#structure-of-book .unnumbered}

The book is partitioned into different sections based on the domain it
is involved with. There may be shared definitions and theorems
throughout the chapters, but in general it will start more elementary
and get more advanced.

## Knowledge {#knowledge .unnumbered}

In this book you will find many results, will will characterize them as
being one of the following

-   Theorems - Results that are of importantance and who's proof is not
    easily found (maybe using a novel idea)

-   Propositions - Results of less importance who's proof could be
    constructed without a novel idea

-   Lemmas - Results that are technical intermediate steps which has no
    standing as an independent result on first observation [^1]

-   Corollaries - Results which follow readily from an existing result
    of greater importance

## Recommendations {#recommendations .unnumbered}

By now you might know that in order to actually get better at
mathematics you have to engage with it. This book may be used as a
reference at times, but I highly recommend trying to re-prove statements
or coming up with your own ideas before instantly looking at the
solutions.

get started with this.

If you want to contribute to the project it's most likely that a
contribution will fall into one of the following categories

    -   Adding Definitions, Theorems, ...

    -   Finishing TODO's

    -   Formatting of the book

-   Structural Layout of Project

    -   Organization

    -   Simplyfing the existing structure of the directories

    -   Making scripts which set up new structures

-   External

    -   Adding explanatory content to help onboard new users

    -   Getting others involved

    -   Creating infrastructure to support users (Github discussions)

## Content Based {#content-based .unnumbered}

    an intermediate step, as Zorn's or Fatou's Lemmas did
